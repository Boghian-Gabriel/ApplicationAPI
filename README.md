# API

:information_source:  To run both projects you need to right click on the solution ➡️ properties and select multiple start projects ➡️ then select start for both projects. Then, once you've done that, both the API and MovieWeb projects will run where we display and perform operations based on those services.

:one:. Learn about API using ASP.NET 6.0  EF Core (Code First Approach).

:two:. Work with GitHub.

:three:. Implement Web Api for CRUD ➡️ The API Application.

:four:.  Consume Web API in .NET using Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client ➡️ The MovieWeb Application.

:five:. I will implement several tables with links between them. Here https://github.com/Boghian-Gabriel/API/blob/master/API/Images/DiagramDataBase.PNG you can find some images with the database concept. This diagram is made using the https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com platform.

:six:. I will also learn to implement the authentication and authorization part.

:seven: Testing with swagger & Postman

:eight: Added sample report rdlc in ASP.NET Core 6.0:
        <br />a. Create a new WinForms project. <br />       
        b. After that you have to go up to Extensions ➡️ ManageExtensions and look for REPORT RDLC (:eyes: - :arrow_down:): <br />

        c. Close all projects and Visual Studio, then install RDLC Report, <br />
        d. After finishing the installation, create a new report type file in the WinForms Application. <br />
        e. Then, using the tools that appear, add what you need to the report( :eyes: - :arrow_down: ): <br />

        f. Next, you need to create a controller in the web application to generate this created report. <br />
